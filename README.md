# Ball_game_pygame

Purpose is to learn more about pygame, hande mouse events, start using object oriented programming and how to use GitHub. Hopefully this will prove useful for future projects I have in mind. The project will be developed in several steps, listed below.

#1. Create a Ball with mouse
#2. Make ball move
#3. Make ball bounce against walls
#4. Make ball bounce against other balls (need to think about collision algorithm)
#5. Use mouse (press and hold) to set initial speed and direction of ball

#6. Add Buttons to control mass/radius and dissipation. Link pygame together with PyQt?
#7. Optional, add new windows after winning/losing?
#8. Optional, add Walls/Lines into the game (by right clicking?)
#9. Optional make it possible to win through some goal?(Pool game?)

--> Move on to N-Body project

--> Move on to deformable objects (beam theory?) project (s) (?)

--> Move on to X-code/making apps for iphone. (?)

--> Move on to openGL projects?

-- Move on to server/online/multiple computers based projects?
