# Ball_game_pygame

Purpose is to learn more about pygame, hande mouse events, start using object oriented programming and how to use GitHub. Hopefully this will prove useful for future projects I have in mind. The project will be developed in several steps, listed below.

#1. Create a Ball with mouse
#2. Make ball move
#3. Make ball bounce against walls
#4. Make ball bounce against other balls (need to think about collision algorithm)
#5. Use mouse (press and hold) to set initial speed and direction of ball


#6. Optional, add obstacles into game
#7. Optional make it possible to win through some goal?(Pool game?)
#8. Optional, add new windows after winning/losing?
#9. Add Buttons to control mass/speed etc. Link pygame together with PyQt?
